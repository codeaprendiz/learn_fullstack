## Explaination

The sequence of the output from your Go program is due to how Go evaluates and executes function calls and handlers:

1. **Server Initialization (Terminal 1)**:
    - `simpleLogger(helloWorldHandler)` is evaluated.
    - `simpleLogger` logs "Control : simpleLogger" during its setup (before the return statement).

2. **Handling a Request (Terminal 2)**:
    - When a request is made (`curl -v localhost:8080/path`), the middleware (`simpleLogger`) and the handler (`helloWorldHandler`) are executed.
    - `simpleLogger`'s returned function logs "Control : simpleLogger : inside return".
    - Then, `helloWorldHandler` executes, logging "Control : helloWorldHandler".
    - After `helloWorldHandler` completes, `simpleLogger` logs the request duration ("Request to /path took ...").

This demonstrates the middleware pattern in Go, where the initial log is from the middleware setup, and subsequent logs are from actual request processing.
