              | The Roux Academy gets thousands of submissions every year for artists interesting in participating in the CAC
              | exhibits, and selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of contemporary art for display in their collective
              | exhibit. In addition, 12 individuals are honored as Featured Artists - each being granted his or her own exhibit
              | hall to display entire collections or themed pieces.
            p
              | Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at one of our meetups and share his or her vision, perspective,
              | and techniques with attendees on a more personal level than at our large conference. It is truly an honor to
              | be a CAC Featured Artist and many past students artists who were featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant
              | careers in art.
