/*
Let's break down the code:
- body: This is a CSS selector that targets the body element of an HTML document. It means that the style rules defined within the curly braces {}
  will be applied to the body element and its child elements, unless there is a more specific selector that overrides this style. 
- font-family: Arial, sans-serif; : This line sets the font family for the targeted element(s).
  It specifies that the text should be displayed using the "Arial" font. If the "Arial" font is not available on the user's device, 
  the text will be displayed using a generic "sans-serif" font as a fallback.
